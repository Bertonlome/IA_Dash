It should be able to perceive if the pilot is struggling with the task or if the task has been completed successfully. This can be achieved through monitoring of the pilot's physical movements and the status of the fuel transfer knob.","Medium - The autonomous agent should be able to anticipate the pilot's actions to some extent, especially in emergency situations. However, given the complexity and variability of human behavior, it may not always be able to accurately predict what the pilot will do next. The agent should be designed to handle unexpected actions from the pilot.","Low - The autonomous agent cannot perform the task of manipulating the fuel transfer knob, so its ability to directly influence the pilot's actions in this regard is limited. However, it can support the pilot by providing information, reminders or suggestions. The pilot, on the other hand, should have high directability over the autonomous agent, being able to command it to perform certain actions or to stop performing others."
Engine failure/precautionary shutdown procedure and checklist,Verify engine fire switch affected side is pushed,yellow,yellow,red,,"High - The autonomous agent needs to be able to observe and understand the actions of the human pilot, specifically whether the engine fire switch for the affected side has been pushed or not. This is crucial to ensure the correct procedure is followed during an engine failure or precautionary shutdown.","Medium - The autonomous agent should be able to predict the pilot's actions to a certain extent, especially in emergency situations. However, given the complex and sometimes unpredictable nature of human behavior, it may not always be possible for the agent to accurately predict the pilot's actions.","High - The autonomous agent should be able to influence the pilot's actions, especially in critical situations where the pilot may be under stress or unable to perform the necessary actions. The agent should be able to provide guidance and support to the pilot, ensuring that the correct procedures are followed for engine failure or precautionary shutdown."
Engine failure/precautionary shutdown procedure and checklist,"Announce current checklist completed, checklist to refer next single engine approach and landing",green,green,green,,High - The autonomous agent needs to have a high level of observability to accurately perceive the actions and status of the human pilot. It should be able to monitor the completion status of the current checklist and the readiness of the pilot for the next single engine approach and landing checklist. It should also be able to observe the status of the avionics systems and other relevant controls and instruments.,High - The autonomous agent should be highly predictable in its actions to ensure the safety and efficiency of the flight. The human pilot should be able to anticipate when the agent will announce the completion of the current checklist and the reference to the next one. The agent should also follow a predictable pattern in checking the status of the controls and instruments and in issuing calls to ATC.,"Medium - The autonomous agent should have a medium level of directability. While it should be able to perform tasks independently, it should also be responsive to the directions of the human pilot. For instance, the pilot should be able to direct the agent to delay the announcement of the completion of the current checklist or the reference to the next one if necessary. However, the agent should also have the autonomy to perform certain tasks without the need for direct human control, such as checking the status of the controls and instruments."
