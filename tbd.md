# Coactive Design : Designing Support for Interdependence in Human-Robot Teamwork Johnson PhD. Thesis

OPD are Team **capabilities** that are needed for effective human-machine collaboration

OPD shapes algorithmic support as well as interface support

    IA table can be used to design new systems as well as analyze existing ones.
    The goal of coactive design is flexibility for resilience in teams
    At design time, the designer can choose which aspects of the potential infrastructure to support, based on an assessment of time, effort and utility. At runtime, relationships can be employed as needed to accomplish the work. They may be dynamically adjusted to increase situation awareness, reduce workload, or increase control as deemed appropriate. However, failure to implement support of a given aspect of the infrastructure will mean it is not available and will reduce flexibility.
    When a system designer automates a subtask, what he or she is really doing is performing a type of task distribution and, as such, has introduced novel elements of interdependence within the system (Johnson, Bradshaw, Feltovich, Jonker, et al., 2011). This is the lesson to be learned from studies of the “substitution myth” (Christoffersen & Woods, 2002) which conclude that reducing or expanding the role of automation in joint human-automation systems may change the nature of interdependent and mutually-adapted activities in complex ways. (CAN WE GRASP THIS COMPLEX WAY WITH COGNITIVE MODELLING ???)
    law of stretched systems: “every system is stretched to operate at its capacity; as soon as there is some improvement, for example in the form of new technology, it will be exploited to achieve a new intensity and tempo of activity” (2006, p. 18). Equivalent to the "Effet rebond" in ecology

# Defining Observability, Predictability, and Directability

1. Identify the information requirement for the task work
2. Identify the information requirement for the teamwork for each alternatives
3. Identify the predictability requirement for the teamwork for each alternatives
4. Identify the directability requirement for the teamwork of each alternatives

Observability means making pertinent aspects of one’s status, as well as one’s knowledge of the team, task, and environment observable to others.

Predictability means one’s actions should be predictable enough that others can reasonably rely on them when considering their own actions.

Directability means one’s ability to direct the behavior of others and complementarily be directed by others.

who needs to observe what from whom, who needs to be able to predict what, and how members need to be able to direct each other.
|Tasks   | Hierarchical Sub-Tasks   | Required Capacities | ROBOT* | Human | OPD Requirements
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Navigation   | Avoid obstacles  |Sense obstacles   | green | green |
|   |   | Interpret if obstacle is passable | yellow | yellow | To help, the human needs to observe obstacle and be able to direct robot on interpretation. Robot must be predictable and notify.
|   |   | Decide to avoid to proceed | green | green
